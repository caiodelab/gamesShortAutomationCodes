# How to contribute

If you want to share your own code please follow some guidelines:
1. Create a folder for your code with the name of the game. If it already exists, just use the one that is already there.
2. Add to the folder your code and a README.md text file (or edit the existing one), explaining how the program works and what functions it does.
