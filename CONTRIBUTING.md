# How to contribute

If you want to share your own code please follow some guidelines:
1. Create a new branch with the name `feature/add-script-for-<game>`. Create a folder with the name of the game and, inside it, create one fold for each script with the name of the script. If the game folder already exists, just use that one.
2. Add a README.md text file in the game folder (or edit the existing one), explaining how each script you uploaded works and what functions it does.
