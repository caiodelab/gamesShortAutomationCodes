This is a list of programs for the game Crusader Kings 3.

 - CK3.pyw: This program has two main purposes: to help you reorder the pinned characters list and to donate large sums of gold with more practicality. Runs with Python 3 and uses the following libraries: "pynput", "time" and "playsound". You must have those installed on your computer to run this program properly. This program uses audio files in portuguese to let you know when it is running, paused and closed.
	 - After opening the program, you will have to tap ctrl+F4 to unpause the program, as it starts paused. If you want to pause again, just tap ctrl+F4 once more. The purpose of pausing the program is to be able to use the shortcuts used in the program for another purpose without activating them and without closing the program. The program can be closed by tapping ctrl+F5 (doesn't matter if the program is paused or unpaused).
	 - By tapping ctrl+F1, the program will click once with mouse left button (MLB), then change mouse position to the pin icon in the character's page, click MLB once more, wait a little time and then click MLB again. This will make the character in question go all the way down to last position in the pinned characters list, and very quickly. Please note that due to your screen resolution, this function might not click where it was supposed to, so you may need to edit the file to set up the proper coordinates on your screen. Also, you're supposed to be hovering your mouse above the character's name in the pinned list before using this function.
	 - The next function (donating gold quickly) comes with two commands: ctrl+F2 and ctrl+F3, the former being needed to run the latter. What the ctrl+F2 command does is record 3 positions on your screen: 1. the character you want to donate gold to; 2. the "send gift" dialogue option; 3. the button of confirmation of the donation. It works by recording the first position immediately after you tap ctrl+F2 (so you must be hovering your mouse over the character you want to donate gold before activating this function), then play a confirmation ping (audio) so you know the position was recorded, wait a pre-set delay (3 seconds, you can change it in the code if you want) and record the next position (so you must manually move your mouse to where the next position would be, during the 3-second delay, for the next one be properly recorded). After recording the third and last position, it will play a different ping to let you know that all three positions have been recorded. Then you can use the ctrl+F3 command to run the program that will click in the three positions recorded to donate gold quickly. Useful for donating large sums of gold.
